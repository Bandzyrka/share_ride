# Share Ride Project

## Overview
**Share Ride** is a Java-based application designed to facilitate ride-sharing services. It's structured as a Maven project and includes both backend logic and a graphical user interface.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Handles user registration and login, as seen in `LoginManager.java`, `LoginController.java`, and related handler files.
- **Ride Management**: Allows users to create, join, and manage rides. Key classes include `Ride.java`, `AvailableRidesViewController.java`, and `RideCreationFormController.java`.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes a SQLite database (`users.db`) for storing user and ride information, managed by `DatabaseHelper.java`.
- **User Interface**: Developed using JavaFX, the UI is defined in FXML files (`src/main/resources/com/share_ride/`) and styled with CSS (`src/main/resources/com/share_ride/login.css`).
